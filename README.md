AICTE OIB-SIP Task 3: Car Price Prediction with Machine Learning
Task Description
Predicting car prices using machine learning involves building a model that can estimate the price of a car based on various features such as its brand, model, mileage, engine type, and other relevant factors. The goal is to develop a predictive model that accurately forecasts the price of a car given its characteristics.

Approach:
Data Collection: Obtain a dataset containing information about cars, including features like brand, model, mileage, engine type, year of manufacture, and price.
Data Preprocessing: Clean the data by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and encoding categorical variables if necessary. Perform feature engineering if required, such as creating new features or transforming existing ones.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyze the data to gain insights into the relationships between different features and the target variable (car price). Visualize the data to identify patterns and correlations.
Feature Selection: Select the most relevant features that have a significant impact on the car price to improve the model's performance and efficiency.
Model Building: Choose suitable machine learning algorithms for regression tasks, such as linear regression, decision trees, random forests, or gradient boosting. Train the models using the training data and evaluate their performance using appropriate metrics.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimize the model's hyperparameters to enhance its predictive capability and generalization.
Model Evaluation: Assess the model's performance on the test dataset using evaluation metrics like mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and R-squared (R2) score.
Deployment: Once satisfied with the model's performance, deploy it in a production environment for real-world usage.
